      <bodytext><![CDATA[<p>In 2007 a company called CCS LABS (The Computer Crime Service) which lead the field in digital forensic research and development turned completely away from its commercial roots to tackle what it saw as the greatest challenge of the day – eradicating the sexual exploitation of children. For the next 8 years CCS LABS researched, designed and developed a prototype solution using the most advanced technologies of the day and many new technologies that it developed on its way. In 2015, CCS LABS closed it’s doors after two decades of successful commercial operation and re-invented itself as a completely not-for-profit community organisation called 7ASecond.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today, 7ASecond still lead the way in developing pro-active tools and services to fight child sexual exploitation having long since realised that the reactive systems employed throughout the world was never going to “prevent” the sexual abuse of children. We anticipate the roll-out of most of our tools and services to commence during January – March of 2016.</p>

        <bodytext><![CDATA[<p>One of the main tenets of the administration of 7ASecond has always been the total transparency of our operations. We do not provide such an open door policy to what we do because we think we are perfect and better than all the other charities. It is because we know we are not perfect. We will make mistakes and we want those mistakes spotted as soon as possible so that we can make them right. How we use the money and services we are provided is fundamental to the smooth operation of 7ASecond and as such we provide our accounts here for all to see. They are of course publicly available elsewhere as well; but you should not have to look for such details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although, officially we started in April 2015 there were no transactions at all until July 2015 which is where our accounts start from.</p>

        <topcontent><![CDATA[<p>There is nothing more terrifying for parents, family and friends than to discover that their child is missing. For 7 children a second the reason is because they have fallen prey to a child sexual predator. After many years, design, testing and development we are about to release our mobile application which, through using your mobile phone’s location information, can immediately Alert you if you are in the neighbourhood of a child sex offender.</p>
<p>The application will be provided free of charge as all our applications and services are. However, these applications cost a great deal of money to create and maintain – so don’t forget to make a donation if you think this application would help you!</p>]]></topcontent>

        <title><![CDATA[Report-It!]]></title>
        <topcontent><![CDATA[<p>ReportIt! allows everyone on the internet to report child sexual abuse content on any site, even web sites that have no reporting function.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is no need to leave the page, search for the right organisation to report the content to, find the right page to fill out the report and then complete the report and submit it. All you have to do is right click on the content and select the ReportIt! option; everything else is taken care of for you. The content is even removed from your browser window immediately so you do not have to worry about that either. Imagine 2 Billion internet users being able to immediately report child sexual abuse in such an easy way? There would be nowhere the distribution of this vile content could be hidden. This is a new day in the fight against child sexual abuse on and off-line and 7ASecond are leading the charge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently the Browser Add-Ons are ready and waiting to go but before we release them we need to ensure our infrastructure can handle the inevitable load on resources. So we cannot actually afford to release the tool until we have acquired 500TB of hard disk space upon which our main database, Damocles, will reside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, we have to consider the file hosts as well. They will be inundated with possibly tens of thousands of reports every day to remove content through our new system. So we ensure than no duplicate reports are sent, and that no invalid reports are sent to them either. The only reports they will receive from us is for <em>verified illegal content</em>. In order to verify the content we require access to the file hosts files or better still to a management API which will allow us to access the files in question and remove them directly if they are illegal. This free Content Management Service will relieve a great deal of the financial and legal burden from the hosts allowing them to focus on what they do best – provide excellent services to their customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With this in mind we will be working with our partners to establish an External Management API which allows us to download reported files, verify they are criminal and remove them from the host’s servers if necessary. Whilst this API is being created we will simply send the links via email once they have been checked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>THE REPORT-IT PROCESS FROM START TO FINISH</h4>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How do we make something as complicated as reporting child sexual abuse sites, pages, pictures, videos, text and downloadable content such as pdf files, zip archives and encrypted files so easy? How can it be done on sites that have no reporting functionality? This and more will be answered in this document which tries to explain the complete process of the Report-It service in simple to understand steps from the moment you open your browser.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently the Report-It service is offered through a browser add-on. Within 18 months we anticipate that it will be written into the core of all major browsers as standard, but for now as we demonstrate the amazing features and powers to protect we have our add-on. The add-on has not yet been released for public consumption as we still need to beef up our infrastructure. There are 2 billion internet users who theoretically could all report child sexual abuse content each day. That is five times more traffic than Google handles each day! We need an infrastructure that can scale to such large proportions. Our API is hosted on Microsoft’s Azure cloud hosting service which of course will provide the scale required, if we can afford the associated costs. Remember we do not charge for ANY of our services. The database which receives all the reports needs to be more protected and under our direct control so there is a clear line of responsibility for the data contained therein. This database we initially will have housed on an array of 500TB of hard drives – equivalent of around 500 home computers. With the overall internet connection needing to handle 2 billion connections in a day communicating around 3kb of data each, around 6TB of data; which is around 6000 times the world’s average home’s monthly download limit. However, once we have this infrastructure in place – hopefully by the beginning of 2016 we will enable all internet users the ability to easily and safely police the internet.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5>2 CLICK REPORTING</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>So, our add-on will first need to be installed. A user will simply use their browser’s add-on installer to install and run the add-on. Once this is done they will have a new menu option available on their context menu. The context menu is the menu that is displayed when you right click upon something. It changes depending upon what (the context) you click on. Our Report-It menu option will always be shown.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When a user discovers any illegal content they simply right click on the offending content and click Report-It. That is all they have to do. I think you will agree nothing could be simpler for the user. But, that is not the end of the story. Report-It is far more complicated than that. To make it simple for the end user so that they actually use the facility we needed to take the burden of all the complexities that other reporting services leave to the end user – which many end users will simply not be prepared to work through.</p>
<div class="su-box su-box-style-soft">
<div class="su-box-title"></div>
<div class="su-box-title"></div>
<div class="su-box-title"></div>
<div class="su-box-title" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Important!</strong></em></div>
<div class="su-box-content su-clearfix" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>It is illegal in most jurisdictions of the world to look or search for criminal content of any kind. End users must not look for criminal content to report as they could be prosecuted. However, if they accidentally discover Child Sexual Abuse Content then they should report it.</strong></em></div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Immediately the user clicks on the abuse content it is removed from their browser and replaced with a marker which shows that the content has been removed by the Report-It Service.  If the user goes to another site and the exact same file is present on that site – it too will automatically be replaced with one of our markers. Meanwhile the actual information about the location of the reported content is being sent to our servers for processing. Currently we have two local servers that are used during this testing phase called Tokyo and Kyoto as well as one remote server which is the home of the API and is on the 7ASecond.Net domain. Both Tokyo and Kyoto do the same work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5>TRIAGE ON RECEIPT OF THE REPORT</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>Although the user who has reported the content is immediately protected from the offending material it remains available to all others. This is where the processing servers have their role. The API sends the report to our database flagged as needing processing. There is also a report counter so that we processes the files most commonly seen first and not just in the order that they are being reported. In the most simplest of explanations this means that if someone reports file A and two people report file B, file B will be processed before file A as that will protect the most internet users.</p>
<h5>REPORT-IT BACKGROUND WORKER</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>A program runs continuously on the database server which processes the reported files in order of most importance and explained above. The content is downloaded and an automated digital forensic investigation is started. The first stage of that investigation is the digital hashing of the file which produces a digital fingerprint of the file. We compare that hash with the database of hashes that we have access to. If the hash is already on the database but has not been processed with us the following process is followed:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Known but Not Processed</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Knowing that the file is of a criminal content is sufficient to report the file to the hosts which is explained later. However, as our processing of the criminal content is more thorough than other services we still need to process the file. The first thing we do is extract all the faces from the content if any. These faces are automatically checked to see if they have appeared in any previous content that we have processed. If they are new to us a new report is opened for each of the faces which are linked to a report for the content itself. If we have seen any of the faces before automatically determined in the first instance by computer vision forensics, then we add this file to the report relating to the faces and create a master report if one does not exist which holds information concerning all the content that these faces are found in. Basically this means that each face has a document attached to it which contains information about the person and information about the content that the person is found in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unknown</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When we find unknown content it must be manually checked to see if the file is illegal content, or just an image of Justin Bieber that someone humorously reported as offensive. Unknown content is categorised into three types.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-">
<ul>
<li><strong>Type A</strong>: Content that is universally Allowed to be viewed.</li>
<li><strong>Type R</strong>: Content that is restricted in a particular jurisdiction to only a sub-group of the population such as adult pornographic material</li>
<li><strong>Type C</strong>: Content which is criminal in nature for the population to posses within that Jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>We keep the hashes, digital fingerprints, of all files we process so that we do not need to process them again if they are later found and reported.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5>JURISDICTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>Laws are not universal in nature and what is regarded as illegal content in one country or jurisdiction does not mean it is illegal elsewhere. This leads us to protecting internet users from criminal content that is hosted in a country where that content is not criminal. again, unlike any other service 7ASecond has that covered within the Report-It system. Report-It uses the user’s location to determine which content is illegal and automatically prevents the user from seeing that content, even if it is hosted in another jurisdiction where the content is legal. We also know where the file hosts are and can through that location decide if the content they are hosting is illegal for them to host. This does not just cover the servers that the files are on but also the location where the company is registered that is providing the hosting.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5>REPORTING TO THE HOST</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>All illegal content is reported to the host; that is the owners of the server upon which the file resides. This is most often a file sharing host. 7ASecond is partners with a number of file sharing hosts and the list is increasing all the time. This gives us the unique ability to check reported content and have illegal content removed quickly. It removes a great deal of pressure from the file hosts as they can simply remove the files we report without validating the reports first. We are also working with our partners to create a remote management API which will allow us to remove illegal content directly saving the file hosts a great deal of time and money.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When a file is reported to a host we monitor the file to ensure that it is removed in a timely manner, and that if the content is not removed a “final reminder” is sent which if ignored leads us to reporting the matter to the law enforcement agency that are closest to the servers hosting the offending content. We also send them all the applicable forensic evidence that we have gained. If the company that is supplying the hosting servers is registered in a different country we also report to that law enforcement agency. Finally, we report the content to all the major site blocking organisations around the world where applicable.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5>IN SUMMARY</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>To suggest that is Report-It in a “nutshell” would be grossly inaccurate. We have not mentioned the multiple layers of encryption that is used, the sharing of the criminal records with law enforcement nor have we mentioned the aggressive auditing we do of our entire systems to prevent abuse. Nevertheless, I think this gives a reasonable idea of the complexity behind the Report-It system and why no other service will ever be able to provide the pro-active protection that can be provided by 7ASecond.Net.</p>]]></topcontent>

<li>the date on which he/she/it was appointed as a Charity Trustee; and</li>
<li>any office held by him/her/it in the organisation; and</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for each former Charity Trustee - for at least 6 years from the date on which he/she/it ceased to be a Charity Trustee:
<ul>
<li>the name of the Charity Trustee; and</li>
<li>any office held by him/her/it in the organisation; and</li>
<li>the date on which he/she/it ceased to be a Charity Trustee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Board must ensure that the register of Charity Trustees is updated within 28 days of any change:
<ul>
<li>which arises from a resolution of the Board; or</li>
<li>which is notified to the organisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If any person requests a copy of the register of charity trustees, the Board must ensure that a copy is supplied to him/her within 28 days, providing the request is reasonable; if the request is made by a person who is not a Charity Trustee of the organisation, the board may provide a copy which has the addresses blanked out. The SCIO may, if it is satisfied that including the names of any or all of the charity trustees is likely to jeopardise the safety or security of any person or premises, remove the name(s).  Such a decision must be taken on a case by case basis, justified and minuted at a meeting of the Board of charity trustees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Office-bearers</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Charity Trustees must elect (from among themselves) a Convenor, a Treasurer and a Secretary.</li>
<li>In addition to the office-bearers required under clause 33, the Charity Trustees may elect (from among themselves) further office-bearers if they consider that appropriate.</li>
<li>All of the office-bearers will cease to hold office at the conclusion of each AGM, but may then be re-elected at the first Board meeting after the AGM, under clauses 33 and 34.</li>
<li>A person/nominated individual/corporate body elected to any office will automatically cease to hold that office: -
<ul>
<li>if he/she/it ceases to be a charity trustee; <em>and/or</em></li>
<li>if he/she/it gives to the organisation a notice of resignation from that office, signed by him/her/its authorised officer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Powers of Board</h2>
<ul>
<li>Except where this constitution states otherwise, the organisation (and its assets and operations) will be managed by the Board; and the Board may exercise all the powers of the organisation.</li>
<li>A meeting of the Board at which the appropriate quorum (as set out in clauses 55 and 68) is present may exercise all powers exercisable by the Board.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Charity Trustees - general duties &amp; remuneration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each of the Charity Trustees has a duty, in exercising their functions as a Charity Trustee, to act in the interests of the organisation; and, in particular, must:-
<ul>
<li>seek, in good faith, to ensure that the organisation acts in a manner which is in accordance with its purposes; and</li>
<li>act with the care and diligence which it is reasonable to expect of a person who is managing the affairs of another person; and</li>
<li>in circumstances giving rise to the possibility of a conflict of interest between the organisation and any other party:
<ul>
<li>put the interests of the organisation before that of the other party; or</li>
<li>where any other duty prevents him/her from doing so, disclose the conflicting interest to the organisation and refrain from participating in any deliberation or decision of the other Charity Trustees with regard to the matter in question;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ensure that the organisation complies with any direction, requirement, notice or duty imposed under or by virtue of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition to the duties outlined in clause 39, all of the Charity Trustees must take such steps as are reasonably practicable for the purpose of ensuring: -
<ul>
<li>that any breach of any of those duties by a Charity Trustee is corrected by the Charity Trustee concerned and not repeated; and</li>
<li>that any Charity Trustee who has been in serious and persistent breach of those duties is removed as a Charity Trustee as described in clause 28.7.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provided he/she/it has declared his/her/its interest - and has not voted on the question of whether or not the organisation should enter into the arrangement - a Charity Trustee will not be debarred from entering into an arrangement with the organisation in which he/she/it has a private interest; and (subject to clauses 42 and 43 and to the provisions relating to remuneration for services contained in Sections 67, 68 and 68A of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005), he/she/it may retain any private benefit which arises from that arrangement.</li>
<li>No Charity Trustee may serve as an employee (having entered into a full time or part time contract) of the organisation with the only exception being as stated in clause 43.</li>
<li>For the avoidance of doubt, it is permissible for a Charity Trustee to be employed as a temporary sessional worker, provided that:
<ul>
<li>such employment is explicitly authorised by the Board; and</li>
<li>it is temporary; and</li>
<li>it be in accordance with the rules laid down in clause 41.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No Charity Trustee may be given any remuneration by the organisation for carrying out his/her/its duties as a Charity Trustee.</li>
<li>The Charity Trustees may be paid all ‘out of pocket’ travelling and other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with carrying out their duties; this may include expenses relating to their attendance at meetings. The Charity Trustees must have a written policy and approved procedure on such matters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code of conduct for Charity Trustees</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each of the Charity Trustees shall comply with the code of conduct of the organisation (incorporating detailed rules on conflict(s) of interest) adopted by the Board.</li>
<li>The code of conduct referred to in clause 46 shall be supplemental to the provisions relating to the conduct of Charity Trustees contained in this constitution and the duties imposed on Charity Trustees under the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005. All relevant provisions of this constitution shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with the provisions of the code of conduct which must be annually reviewed by the Board.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>DECISION-MAKING BY THE CHARITY TRUSTEES</h1>
<h2>Notice of meetings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any Charity Trustee may call a meeting of the Board <em>and/or</em> ask the secretary to call a meeting of the Board.</li>
<li>At least 14 clear days’ notice must be given of the AGM, or of a Board meeting at which the business of the meeting includes consideration of any resolution.</li>
<li>At least 7 clear days' notice must be given for other Board meetings unless in the opinion of the Convenor there is a degree of urgency which makes that inappropriate.</li>
<li>The notice calling an AGM or a Board meeting at which the business of the meeting includes consideration of any resolution, must specify in general terms what business is to be dealt with at the meeting; and
<ul>
<li>in the case of any other resolution falling within clause 69 (requirement for two-thirds majority) must set out the exact terms of the resolution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reference to “clear days” in clauses 49 and 50 shall be taken to mean that, in calculating the period of notice,
<ul>
<li>the day after the notices are posted (or sent by e-mail) should be excluded; and</li>
<li>the day of the meeting itself should also be excluded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notice of the AGM and Board meetings must be given to all the Charity Trustees; but the accidental omission to give notice to one or more Charity Trustees will not invalidate the proceedings at the meeting.</li>
<li>Any notice which requires to be given to a Charity Trustee under this constitution must be: -
<ul>
<li>sent by post to the Charity Trustee, at the address last notified by him/her to the organisation and on the register of charity trustees as described in clause 30; <em>and/or </em></li>
<li>sent by e-mail to the Charity Trustee, at the e-mail address last notified by him/her to the organisation. It is the responsibility of each Charity Trustee to keep their personal email details up to date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure at Board meetings</h2>
<ul>
<li>No valid decisions can be taken at a Board meeting unless a quorum is present; the quorum for Board meetings is 3 [Three] Charity Trustees, or 1/3 of the Charity Trustees if greater than three, present in person, except for Board meetings at which a resolution(s) is to be considered, as described in clause 68.</li>
<li>If at any time the number of Charity Trustees in office falls below the number stated as the quorum in clause 55, the remaining Charity Trustee(s) will have power to fill the vacancies - but will not be able to take any other valid decisions.</li>
<li>The Convenor of the organisation should act as convenor of each Board meeting.</li>
<li>If the Convenor is not present within 15 minutes after the time at which the meeting was due to start (or is not willing to act as Convenor), the Charity Trustees present at the meeting must elect (from among themselves) the person who will act as chairperson of that meeting.</li>
<li>Every Charity Trustee has one vote, which must be given personally except in the case of a vote with regard to a resolution under clause 65 and 66.</li>
<li>All decisions at Board meetings will be made by majority vote. (For procedure on resolutions either at Board meetings or AGMs see clauses 65 - 72).</li>
<li>If there are an equal number of votes for and against any decision, the Convenor or the chairperson of the meeting (in the circumstances described in clause 58) will be entitled to a second (casting) vote.</li>
<li>The Board may, at its discretion, allow any person to attend and speak at a Board meeting notwithstanding that he/she is not a Charity Trustee - but on the basis that he/she must not participate in decision-making. The minute of that meeting must make the status of any such person clear for the avoidance of doubt as to their status.</li>
<li>A Charity Trustee must not vote at a Board meeting (or at a meeting of a sub-committee) on any decision which relates to a matter in which he/she/it has a private interest or duty which conflicts (or may conflict) with the interests of the organisation; he/she/it must withdraw from the meeting while an item of that nature is being dealt with as described in clause 39, 46 and 47.</li>
<li>For the purposes of clause 63: -
<ul>
<li>Any private interest held by an individual who is “connected” with the Charity Trustee under section 68(2) of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 (husband/wife, partner, child, parent, brother/sister and their spouses etc) shall be deemed to be held by that Charity Trustee; and/or</li>
<li>a Charity Trustee will be automatically deemed to have a private interest in relation to a particular matter, if a body in relation to which he/she is an employee, director, member of the management committee, charity trustee, officer or elected representative has an interest in that matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Voting on Resolutions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every Charity Trustee has one vote with regard to voting on resolutions, which (whether on a show of hands or on a secret ballot as described in clauses 71 and 72) may be given either personally, or by proxy given to a fellow Charity Trustee.</li>
<li>A member who wishes to appoint a fellow Charity Trustee as their proxy to vote on his/her/its behalf with regard to (and only with regard to) resolutions, must lodge with the Convenor or the chairperson of that meeting (in the circumstances described in clause 58), prior to the time when the meeting commences, a written proxy authorisation form, signed by him/her/its authorised representative.</li>
<li>All decisions on resolutions will be made by majority vote - with the exception of the types of resolution listed in clause 69.</li>
<li>The quorum for meetings (AGMs or Board meetings) at which a resolution(s) is to be considered is 3 [Three] or 50% + 1 of the Trustees if greater than three. For these meetings, and these meetings only, this quorum shall include proxies as described in clauses 65 and 66.</li>
<li>The following resolutions will be valid only if passed by not less than two thirds of those voting (either on person or by proxy as described in clauses 65 and 66) on the resolution at an AGM or at a Board meeting (or if passed unanimously by way of a written resolution under clause 73) and will also be subject, (with the exception of clauses 69.2 and 69.3) to clause 89:
<ul>
<li>a resolution amending the constitution (including changing the name of the organisation); or</li>
<li>a resolution expelling a person from Charity Trusteeship under clauses 28.5, 28.6, 28.7 or 28.8; or</li>
<li>a resolution directing the Board to take any particular action (or directing the board not to take any particular action); or</li>
<li>a resolution approving the amalgamation of the organisation with another SCIO (or approving the constitution of the new SCIO to be constituted as the successor pursuant to that amalgamation); or</li>
<li>a resolution to the effect that all of the organisation’s property, rights and liabilities should be transferred to another SCIO (or agreeing to the transfer from another SCIO of all of its property, rights and liabilities); or</li>
<li>a resolution for the winding-up of the organisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there are an equal number of votes for and against any resolution, the Convenor or chairperson of the meeting (in the circumstances described in clause 58), will be entitled to a second (casting) vote.</li>
<li>A resolution put to the vote at an AGM or Board meeting will be decided on a show of hands - unless the Convenor or chairperson of the meeting (or at least two other Charity Trustees present at the meeting, whether voting personally or as proxies), ask for a secret ballot.</li>
<li>The Convenor or chairperson of the meeting will decide how any secret ballot is to be conducted, and he/she will declare the result of the ballot at the meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Written resolutions by Charity Trustees</h2>
<ul>
<li>A resolution agreed to in writing (including by e-mail) by all the Charity Trustees will be as valid as if it had been passed at an AGM or Board meeting; the date of the resolution will be taken to be the date on which the last member agreed to it and it must be unanimous.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Minutes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Board must ensure that proper minutes are kept in relation to all Board meetings and meetings of sub-committees.</li>
<li>The minutes to be kept under clause 74 must include the names of those present; and (so far as possible) should be signed by the Convenor of the meeting.</li>
<li>With due reference to all applicable statutory requirements, it is wholly at the discretion of the Board as to whether or not the minute of a meeting, or any excerpt from the minute of a meeting, is to be made available to members of the public or anybody.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<h2>Delegation to sub-committees</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Board may delegate any of their functions or powers to sub-committees; a sub-committee must include at least one Charity Trustee, but other members of a sub-committee need not be Charity Trustees.</li>
<li>The Board may also delegate to the Convenor of the organisation (or the holder of any other post) such of their powers (but not their responsibilities) as they may consider appropriate.</li>
<li>When delegating powers under clause 77 or 78, the Board must set out appropriate conditions (which must include an obligation to report regularly to the Board).</li>
<li>Any delegation of powers under clause 77 or 78 may be revoked or altered by the Board at any time.</li>
<li>The rules of procedure for each sub-committee, and the provisions relating to membership of each sub-committee, shall be set by the Board.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Operation of accounts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Subject to clause 83, the signatures of two out of three signatories appointed by the Board will be required in relation to all operations (other than the lodging of funds) on the bank and building society accounts held by the organisation; at least one out of the two signatures must be the signature of a Charity Trustee.</li>
<li>Where the organisation uses electronic facilities for the operation of any bank or building society account, the authorisations required for operations on that account must be consistent with the approach reflected in clause 82.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accounting records and annual accounts</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Board must ensure that proper accounting records are kept, in accordance with all applicable statutory requirements.</li>
<li>The Board must prepare an annual statement of account, complying with all relevant statutory requirements; which includes deciding the correct format of the accounts, and the appropriate external scrutiny requirement by either a registered auditor or an appropriately qualified independent examiner.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>MISCELLANEOUS</h1>
<h2>Dissolution and wind-up of the organisation</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Alterations to the constitution</h2>
<ul>
<li>This constitution may (subject to clause 89) be altered by resolution of the Charity Trustees passed at an AGM or Board meeting (subject to achieving the two thirds majority referred to in clause 69) or by way of a unanimous written resolution of the members (as described in clause 73).</li>
<li>The Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 requires that consent is sought from the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) to action the following changes: change of name, an alteration to the purposes, amalgamation and/or winding-up.</li>

        <theirAboutUs><![CDATA[<p>All this time we made many efforts for ensuring safe existence of our site, first of all in regard to pro-active verification of the uploaded files. Our filters caught the majority of attempts of uploading and distribution of undesirable content. And our support reacted to any addresses from the file owners in the 24/7 mode.</p>

<p>But at the same time risks and pressure put upon the market of file hosting services grew. Over the last 3 years many file hosting services have been forced to close due to insufficient measures taken to control the upload of the files, and / or if the inquiries of the file owners were insufficiently quickly processed. At the same time we received the influx of customers who have tried to move to us their questionable files for distribution. And we were forced to fight them with great effort.</p>

        <bodytext><![CDATA[<p>Our Badges of Honour are given to those organisations that fight child sexual abuse or provide front-line services to victims of child sexual abuse or organisations that support and fund the global fight to protect and support child sexual abuse victims. In time, websites that are not showing the badge of honour will be seen as the exception and avoided much the same way as we avoid spending money or logging into sites that are not verified as safe and are using ssl to encrypt and protect our information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently only 7ASecond provide the badges of honour but we are working on a system which will allow any verified front-line service or organisation fighting child sexual abuse the ability to provide badges to those who support them; ensuring everyone is recognised for their efforts and shout out loudly and clearly to everyone who is not fighting to protect children that they are the exception, the odd one's out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our Badges are as follows.</p>
<p><img style="width: 500px; height: 142.76139410187668px;" src="/media/1030/boh-black-founder.png?width=500&amp;height=142.76139410187668" alt="Founders" rel="2121" data-id="2121" /></p>
<p>Founders are front line services that provide support to victims of child sexual abuse, Organisations that provide fight to prevent child sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Partners provide work directly with Founders ensuring that the founders aims are fulfilled; this includes advocates.</p>

<p>Sponsors provide financial support and include all monetary funding sources that Founders benefit from.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Members are all individuals who provide time and effort to assist Founders in achieving their aims.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will be approaching a number of founding groups to create a small steering committee to create the rules, terms, and agreements concerning the operation of the Badge Of Honour scheme which will inevitably be branched off from 7ASecond to become its own individual organisation; purely dedicated to honouring those who actively participate in the fight against the sexual abuse, exploitation, trafficking and rape of children.</p>]]></bodytext>
